# DataAnalysisRepo

**DataAnalysisRepo** is an academic-oriented repository for **physics data analysis and computational modeling**, with a thematic emphasis on **High-Energy Physics (HEP)** and applications to **Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)**, **cosmology**, **gravitational waves**, and **quantum gravity**, while also including rigorous **undergraduate-level physics examples** (e.g., Schrödinger equation, Laplace/Poisson problems, classical dynamics).

The repository integrates:
- **Monte Carlo** techniques (simulation, uncertainty propagation, sampling-based inference),
- **Symbolic computation** with **SymPy**,
- **Numerical computing** with **NumPy/SciPy**,
- and optionally interfaces with **Wolfram Mathematica** for cross-checks, analytic manipulations, and validation workflows.

## Scope

This repository is built around workflows commonly needed in undergraduate/graduate physics research:

- Monte Carlo estimation of observables, integrals, and distributions  
- Uncertainty propagation (linearized and simulation-based)  
- Parameter estimation and inference (least squares, likelihood fits)  
- Symbolic-to-numeric pipelines (derivation → evaluation → validation)  
- Cross-checking results using independent methods (SymPy, numeric solvers, Mathematica)  
- Reproducible research practices with notebook-based narratives

## Thematic Areas

### High-Energy Physics (HEP) / BSM
- Toy-model simulations for BSM phenomenology  
- Likelihood-based fits, toy experiments, and pseudo-data generation  
- MC sampling for parameter scans and constraints (lightweight workflows)  

### Cosmology
- Parameter inference using synthetic or public-like datasets (as permitted)  
- Basic cosmological model fitting and uncertainty propagation  
- Numerical ODE integrations relevant to expansion histories (where applicable)  

### Gravitational Waves
- Signal modeling at a simplified/educational level  
- Matched filtering concepts, SNR estimation, and spectral tools (optional)  
- Parameter sensitivity studies with Monte Carlo  

### Quantum Gravity (Conceptual/Modeling)
- Mathematical toy models and symbolic checks  
- Geometry-inspired examples (where appropriate)  
- Reproducibility-first explorations rather than claims of phenomenology  

### Undergraduate Physics Examples
- Schrödinger equation: numerical solutions, spectra, boundary value problems  
- Laplace/Poisson: finite-difference methods, validation with analytic limits  
- Classical mechanics: data fitting, parameter recovery, uncertainty
